My name is John McCracken. I am recent gradute (December 2022) from The University of Baltimore studying Simulation and Game Design. Over the course of my degree, I have learned many aspects of creating games but have really found my place in Level Design, 3D Art, and Writing. With these skills, I am looking to join a company that I can really sink my teeth into and show them why John McCracken can be a vital member of a team.

I want to learn as much as possible about how games are designed while continuing to self-improve and consistently refine my toolbelt of skills and abilities to maximize my effectiveness in game development. I desire to lead a team of creatives and with the past leadership skills I have developed in the Army as a head medic on a line company, I believe I can achieve that goal. On the game industry side of leadership, I have been a team leader for three separate projects that have resulted in a high marks.

I keep consistent detailed notes for meetings, an open and effective line of communication, and properly delegate work when needed. I believe in a team that can be self-sufficient while working cohesively toward a common goal. I am a gamer who believes in the power of games and have a passion for storytelling. When it comes down to it, I want to give back to people the magic that games have given me.

My name is John McCracken. I graduated from The University of Baltimore in December 2022 with a degree in Simulation and Game Design. During my studies, I developed skills in Level Design, 3D Art, and Writing. With these skills, I am looking for an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to be a valuable member of a team. 

I am committed to learning as much as possible about game design while continuously honing my skills and expanding my capabilities to maximize my influence in game development. I am a strong verbal and written communicator, able to self-manage a successful schedule, and have successfully delegated work as a team leader in three game design projects. 

After establishing myself I am eager to lead a creative team, and with the prior leadership experience I have obtained as a head medic for a line company in the Army, I am confident that I can accomplish this objective. As a gamer, I recognize the power of gaming and am passionate about storytelling. Ultimately, I am determined to give back to the world the same magic that games have given me.
