I graduated from The University of Baltimore in December 2022 with a degree in Simulation and Game Design. During my studies, I developed skills in Level Design, 3D Art, and Writing. With these skills, I am looking for an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to be a valuable member of a team. 

I am committed to learning as much as possible about game design while continuously honing my skills and expanding my capabilities to maximize my influence in game development. I am a strong verbal and written communicator, able to self-manage a successful schedule, and have successfully delegated work as a team leader in three game design projects. 

After establishing myself in a company, I am eager to lead a creative team, and with the prior leadership experience I have obtained as a head medic for a line company in the Army, I am confident that I can accomplish this objective. As a gamer, I recognize the power of gaming and am passionate about storytelling. Ultimately, I am determined to give back to the world the same magic that games have given me.
