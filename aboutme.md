### My Gamer Life

My life as a gamer started early. I grew up in California and started gaming by watching my brother play games I was too young to play, games such as Zelda and Metroid on the NES. 
I started my own gaming pursuit by the age of six, but because of our constant moving and family dynamic I wasn't a full gamer until I was a bit older. 
From the first game I watched, my love for the industry grew. All the things the gaming industry is able to accomplish through the medium blew me away. 
I wasn't a fully established gamer until about nine or ten years of age, after I moved in with my Dad. Shortly after I had been there he bought the first playstation when it came out. 
The first one he bought was a dud as so many of the first generation were, but it was exhanged until we had one that worked.
Around this time I found out my oldest brother had started working for Eidos in San Fransisco. This was a huge influence in my gaming life. 
I had my own gaming Idol to gawk after in my own family. He introduced a lot of games to my dad over the years such as 
Tomb Raider and Diablo 2. Both of which were big influences on my Dad, and in turn, I as well. Final Fantasy VII was one of the first games 
I sank a solid amount of hours into and the first game that really made me feel for characters in any story like I never have before. 


Continuing into adolecence I started playing games such as Metal Gear Solid and Diablo 2. Diablo 2 was the second game that changed me in a large way. Not only did I sink coupious 
amounts of hours into it, it showed me a genre of games I would go on to love and enjoy to this day. It's a game that made me want to get into game development so that I could make a game as fun and engaging as Diablo 2.
My older brother did a great job converting my father into a gamer, as Dad started buying all the new consoles when they came out. Games through that time just compounded the gamer life in me and pushed my desire to be in the 
game industry even more. Series such as Halo, Elder Scrolls and Half life had a profound impact on me at that time. It was the time I really started to challenge myself as a gamer and beat any game I could sink my teeth into.


In my early High School years the behemoth of a game from Blizzard, World of Warcraft, came out. 
That game just about single handedly shut down my school career in almost an instant on top of playing Counter Strike at the time. 
Never have I blow 15 hours in a day gaming, and not even notice the time melting away. The "WoW crack" was real and this was the start of game bingeing for me. Understanding who I am early on, drove my parents crazy. 
They wanted a good kid who was very successful at school. Well they got half of that and even though I would test high, I hated homework. I felt it got in the way of the little 
free time I thought I already had and I really wasn't interested anyway. I pay attention in school and learned a lot but there was nothing that school was offering me that I wanted to pursue further. I wanted much more than that. 
I wanted to be the head of a game development studio. I wanted to create the exerience for the player as I have had experinced so many times in games before. 
I wanted to write scripts for games that brought people to their knees, and some that lifted them so high they forgot any wrongs in the world. I just didnt know how to achieve that on my own at the time.
I was never moved going to school other than in ways that pushed me further away from following the "norm". By the end of a rocky high school career I exited with an exempllory GED and moved on.


Soon after High School, in the Fall, I had a drastic life change that threw everyone for a loop. I had made a string of bad decision and had to move 
back in with my Mom as I had severly severed relations with my Father at that point. We're good now, but I became a no life gamer for about 3-4 years after that. 
I had a hard time picking myself up and doing the adult thing. Doing what I needed to get done in order for me to progress through life and 
achieve some of the things that I wanted to achieve, but life always got in the way as much as possible it seemed and I started losing hope.
I went to a local community college during those years but couldnt bring myself to take more than one or two classes at a time. It wasn't until I met a friend that eventually led me going into the military. 
The Army was another huge change in my life that served it's purpose but I think I'm just going to leave it at that for now. I came out the otherside with a wife and daughter and moved to the East Coast.
I had straightened out to a degree from where I was because now I had significant responsibility. Finishing up my Network Engineering degree after the military was an accomplishment that gave me insight that I **was** able to achieve.


As I was finishing my associates degree I had a very difficult time figuring out where I wanted to go from there. I finished my degree just for that simple reason, so that it's finished, not so that I can pursue a career in Network Engineering. 
Now was the time for me to pick what I wanted to do with my life, or so it felt at the time. It took me almost two more years before I went back to school full time to pursue a Bachelors in Simulation and Game Design.
I had finally gotten to a place where I could pursue everything I wanted as a young person, but after so much life, I got hung up on everything else. 
I stumbled and half-assed my way through my classes at the start but it wasn't until my thrid year being there that I found a foot hold. Development software and desiplines that grabbed my attention. Finally, I could pursue my childhood dreams.
