My name is John McCracken. I love games. I also love all aspects of making them. Here is what I can do for you:

#### Proficient
- 3D Art
- Level Design
- Writing
- Photography

#### Familiar
- 2D Art
- Animation
- C# Programming
- HTML/CSS/MD Website Development

Need something else? I'll learn that too.


I am currently a Senior at The University of Baltimore studying Simulation and Game Design. I am on track to graduate in December 2022. I have achieved Dean's List for the past two semesters in a row and am aiming to graduate with honors. Over the course of my degree, I have learned almost every aspect of creating games but have really found my place in Level Design, 3D Art, and Writing. With these skills, I am looking to join a company that I can really sink my teeth into and show them why John McCracken is a vital member of a team.


I want to absorb as much information as possible about how games are designed at a AAA level as well as continue to self-improve and consistently refine my toolbelt of skills and abilities to maximize my effectiveness in game development. I desire to lead a team of creatives and with the past leadership skills I have developed in the Army as a head medic on a line company, I believe I can achieve that goal. On the game industry side of leadership, I have been a team leader for three separate projects that have resulted in a high B grade or better.


I keep consistent detailed notes for meetings, an open and effective line of communication, and properly delegate work when needed. I believe in a team that can be self-sufficient while working cohesively toward a common goal. I am a gamer who believes in the power of games and have a passion for storytelling. When it comes down to it, I want to give back to people the magic that games have given me over the course of my life.
