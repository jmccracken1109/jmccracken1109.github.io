### My Early Gaming Life

My life as a gamer started early. I was introduced to gaming by watching my youngest older brother play games I was too young to play at the time, games such as Zelda and Metroid on the NES. 
I started my own gaming pursuit by the age of six on both console and PC, but because of our constant moving and family dynamic I didn't identify as being a full gamer until I was a bit older. 
From the first game I experienced, my love for the industry grew. All the things the gaming industry is able to accomplish through the medium blew me away. 
I wasn't a fully established gamer until about nine or ten years of age, after I moved in with my Dad. Shortly after I had been there he bought the first playstation when it came out. 
Around this time I found out my oldest brother had started working for Eidos in San Fransisco. This was a huge influence throughout my gaming life. 
He introduced a lot of games to my dad over the years such as Tomb Raider, Resident Evil on the Playstation and Diablo 2 on PC. Both of which I watched my dad play through long before I ever got my hands on them. Final Fantasy VII was one of the first games 
I sank a solid amount of hours into and the first game that really made me feel for characters in any story like I never have before. Aerith's death is a core memory from my early gaming days.


Continuing into adolecence I started playing games such as Metal Gear Solid and Diablo 2. Diablo 2 was the second game that changed me in a large way. Not only did I sink coupious 
amounts of hours into it, it showed me a genre of games I would go on to love and enjoy to this day(ARPGs). It's a game that made me want to get into game development so that I could make a game as fun and engaging as Diablo 2.
My Dad typically bought all the new consoles eventually. Games through that time just compounded the gamer life in me and pushed my desire to be in the 
game industry even more. Series such as Halo, Elder Scrolls and Half life had a profound impact on me at that time. It was the time I really started to challenge myself as a gamer and beat any game I could sink my teeth into. In my early High School years World of Warcraft came out, and for the next two expansions after that it took up most of my free time. 


Now with all this game knowledge and experince over many years and countless games I would like to be able to give that back to other players. To impact someone with a powerful scene or to engage a players interest over many years would feel very fulfilling.
