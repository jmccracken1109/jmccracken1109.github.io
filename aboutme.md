My name is John McCracken. I love games. I also love all aspects of making them. Here is what I can do for you:

#### Proficient
- 3D Art
- Level Design
- Writing
- Photography

#### Familiar
- 2D Art
- Animation
- Programming
- Website Development

Need something else? I'll learn that too.


I am currently a Senior at The University of Baltimore studying Simulation and Game Design. I am on track to graduate in December 2022. I have achieved Dean's List for the past two semesters in a row and am aiming to graduate with honors. Over the course of my degree I have learned almost every aspect of creating games but have really found my place in Level Design, 3D Art, and Writing. With these skills I am looking to join a company that I can really sink my teeth into. I want to absorb as much information about how games are designed at a AAA level as well as conitnue to self-imporove and consistantly refine my toolbelt of skills and abilities. I desire to lead a team of creatives and with my past leadership skills I have developed in the Army as a head medic on a line company, and I believe I can achieve that goal. On the game industry side of leadership I have been team leader for three seperate projects that have resulted in a high B grade or better.
