### My Gamer Life

My life as a gamer started early. I grew up watching my brother play games I was too young to be playing, things such as Zelda and Metroid on the NES. 
I started my own gaming pursuit by the age of six, but because of our constant moving and family dynamic I wasn't a full gamer until I was a bit older. 
From there my love for the industry only grew. All the things the gaming industry is able to accomplish through the medium blew me away. I wasn't a fully established gamer until about nine or ten years of age, after 
I moved in with my Dad. Shortly after I had been there he bought the first playstation when it came out. The first one he bought was a dud as so many 
of the first generation were but was exhanged until we had one that worked.


Around this time I found out my brother had started working for Eidos in San Fransisco. 
This was another huge influence in my gaming life. I had my own gaming Idol to gawk after in my own family. Final Fantasy VII was one of the first games I sank a solid amount of hours into. 
Continuing in the adolecence I started playing games such as Metal Gear Solid and Diablo 2. Diablo 2 was a game that changed me. Not only sinking coupious 
amounts of hours into it, it showed me a genre of games I would go on to love and enjoy to this day. In my early High School years the behemoth of a game from Blizzard, World of Warcraft, came out. 
That game just about single handedly shut down my school career in almost an instant. Never have I blow 15 hours in a day gaming and not even notice the time melting away.
